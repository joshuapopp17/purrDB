# purrDB üêæ
Thank you for using purrDB
Yeah I like cats.üòª

This is a 100% client side DB using localstorage in the web browser.
I got annoyed using all these third party API's just to make a simple web app.
For that reason I made my own local storage interface to make it easy.
It's a work in progress but I am happy with it so far.
