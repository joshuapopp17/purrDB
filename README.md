# purrDB 🐾
Thank you for checking out purrDB. 😻

This is a 100% client side DB using localstorage in the web browser.
I got annoyed using all these third party API's just to make a simple web app.
For that reason I made my own local storage interface to make it easy.
It's a work in progress, but I would love feedback.
